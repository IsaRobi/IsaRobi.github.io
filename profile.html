  <p> Hello, I am Isaac Robinson thanks for looking at this webpage. This coding is new for me and is honestly pretty cool because I always thought the code behind the site was complicated. In reality, it is.
  It's cool that I can dip my toes in it because one day I want to have my website for my business so I can reach consumers in broader areas. This is my last semester at UNC before I head off into the real world
  and it is nice that I can learn some new skills before I go.</p>
